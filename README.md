# Etch-a-Sketch

A browser-based drawing application that combines the functionality of a digital sketchpad with the nostalgic feel of an Etch-A-Sketch, built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

## Description

The application starts with a default 16x16 grid of square cells. As you hover your mouse over each cell, it changes to a blue background, creating a pixelated mouse trail. 

Click the "Create New Grid" button to customize your grid. Enter any number between 1 and 100 to set the number of squares per side. The new grid will occupy the same screen space as before, with individual cells automatically resizing to fit.


## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I practiced creating, modifying, and removing HTML elements within the DOM. 

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the project files
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Start drawing by moving your mouse over the grid!
